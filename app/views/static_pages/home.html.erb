          <strong>Fork recipes</strong> - Maybe you've made Mrs X's Favorite Apple Pie, but changed a few of the ingredients.  You can now save the recipe with those changes and make it your own.  Forking automatically imports all the data from the recipe and allows you to change the ingredients, and then save the new recipe.

				One feature of Use Your Foodle is the Fork Recipe feature.  By going to any recipe you can click on the Fork Recipe link.  This brings up the New Recipe form with all the recipes data already added.  Here you can change any part of the recipe you didn't like.  Think the recipe should've had more cheese?  Add it!  Thought the bake time should be reduced?  Change it!  Clicking save will save your changes as a new recipe forked(i.e. changed) from the original recipe.
			</p>
			<p>
				The best part is we'll keep track of all the forks to a recipe through our Fork Tree.  You can access the Fork Tree of any recipe by clicking the link that says "View the Fork Tree". There you'll see all the changes people have made to a recipe.  You'll never have to search through the comments section on how to make a recipe better.
			</p>
			<p>
				Can you fork a forked recipe?  Of course!  On the fork recipe page we'll also show you a few of the double forks.  As a premium member you'll be able to easily look through all the forks of a particular recipe.
